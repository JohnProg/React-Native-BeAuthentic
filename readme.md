# BeAuthentic 

BeAuthentic helps you learn more about yourself, and others, by providing meaningful questions for you to answer and ask, in the app, or in real life. 

* Question of the day encourages you to learn more about yourself everyday.
* Keep track of your growth for yourself by answering through the app (making answers public is optional).
* Find more questions based on user made collections, tags, or by topics/situations/participants.
* Ask your own question and get other people's thought / find others similar to you. 
* Random question button allows you to get a question in a pinch--nobody wants you to be staring at your phone during a conversation.
* Connect with others around the globe by sharing thoughts through each question's answer section. 
* Authentic conversation: meaningful conversations are two way streets, so you can only see answer from others if you have shared yours.

App contains broad topics from: 
* Relationships and determining compatibility
* Networking/interview 
* Self-growth 
* Personal principles
* Double dates
* and more!

Never have another boring conversation about the weather again... (it's always sunny in California (and Philadelphia))
